From naive bayes explanation 

This manual calculation of the posterior for every new data point is only
possible when the number of examples is low. When the number of datapoints is
high, extraction of the parameters for the appropriate assumed distribution ison of
the posterior, one must extract the parameters of the assumed distributions of
the various portions of the equation (for the data likelihoods, the prior,
the marginals, etc). For this example
the data likelihoods and marginals are all Gaussian. The relative means of each
of the distributions can easily be seen from the data table (35,000, 40, 15 for
each of the features marginal and conditional probabilities). The variances can
be calculated by summing the distances from the means and dividing by the number
of points in each given distribution, at which point all the means and variances
will be known. Plugging these values into the definition of the Gaussian
$$p(x|\mu,\rho^{2})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\rho^{2}}}e^{\frac{x-\mu^{2}}{\rho^{2}}}$$
would give us the probability for each of the values for a given new data point,
at which point the calculation of the posterior would follow in exactly the same
fashion as the ``by hand'' example.
