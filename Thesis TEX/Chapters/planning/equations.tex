%K-means clustering equations
1. Loss function $$L = \sum_{j=i}^{k} \sum_{i=1}^{n}$$a_{ij}(x_i - \mu_j)^2$$
where a_{ij} is whether or not input i is assigned to cluster j and x_i - u_j
is the distance from the center of input i (which only impacts the loss function
when a_{ij} is 1 and not 0 aka when the point is assigned to the currently evaluated cluster j)

2. Update function for the maxization step of kmeans
$$\mu_j=1/n_j\sum_{i:x_i is assigned to j}x_i $$ , emperical mean of all points assigned to j. Is undefined when number of assigned points n_{j} is 0

3. Update function for expectation step of kmeans requires amsmath
a_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
    1,& \text{if } j = argmin_{l} ||x_i-\mu_l||^2 \\
    0,              & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}


Expectation maximization stuff
1. Expectation step
Q(\theta,\theta_{t}) = E_{\theta_{t}}(logP_{\theta}(x,z)|x=x)
2. Maximization step
\theta_{t+1} \in argmax_{\theta} Q(\theta,\theta_{t})


Linear regression
1. Primary linear regression equation
$$ y(\textbf{x}) = \textbf{w}^T\textbf{x} + \epsilon = \sum_{j=1}^{D}w_jx_j + \epsilon $$
where $$w^Tx$$ represents the inner or scalar product between the input vector x and the
model's weight vector w^T, and \epsilon is the residual error between our linear predictions
and the true response \cite{Murphy}

Active Learning
1. Sampling Method of Active Learning
$$\delta(V_x,d_i,V_x,d_j) = \frac{|V_x,d_i - V_x,d_j|}{Max_{k\neq i}(V_x,d_k)- Min_{k\neq i}(V_x,d_k)}$$
