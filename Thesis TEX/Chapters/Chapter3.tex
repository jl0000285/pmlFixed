\section{Research Design}
In order to establish the superiority of one metalearning strategy vs another with a given
metabase, the time taken to train the metalearner, the time taken to make a decision with a metalearner, and the accuracy of the metalearner must all be taken into account. A possible cost function that takes these
variables into account is the Inverse error score $\frac{RT}{1-PE}$ where a larger number is asssociated
with worse performance and where $RT$ = Response time and $PE$ is the metalearners Percent error which
is how often it guesses the wrong machine.
