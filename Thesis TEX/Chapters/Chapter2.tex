\section{No Free Lunch Theorem}
Introduced in Wolpert and Macready's ``No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization''
1997 paper, the No Free Lunch theorem states that the performance of all
algorithms, when averaged out across all datasets, should be the same; that is
to say there is no one algorithm that is universally the best. The root cause of
this phenomenon is in that differing algorithms make different assumptions
about the distributions from which the data the algorithms work with arises. A
learning algorithm with an implicit assumption of a random distribution will
have a far lower test case classification accuracy than an algorithm that
assumes a Gaussian distribution if the distribution from which the set of
observed samples derives is truly normal and vice versa, if the
distribution is truly random, the Gaussian classifier's accuracy will suffer
relative to the classifier with a random assumption.

\subsection{Brute Force Metabase}
The most basic meta-machine learning algorithm. The accuracies of the
meta-learners producible machines for some metabase are gathered. To classify
a new dataset $d_n$, a clustering algorithm (K-Means in the case of this experiment) is
used to find $d_m$, the dataset within the metabase with which the new dataset $d_n$ is
most similar. The algorithm which had the greatest classification accuracy for
the metabase dataset $d_m$ will then be returned by the meta-learner.
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Active Meta Learning}
The second of the meta-learning strategies implemented within the study, Active
Meta Learning is a meta learning technique  ``that reduces the cost of
generating Meta examples by selecting relevant Meta examples'' \cite{Bhatt}.
What this entails is a decision on what datasets to allow into a meta-learner's
metabase. Rather than analyze every candidate meta base dataset, an active
meta-learner will analyze the next dataset with the highest uncertainty. The
relative uncertainty between two datasets is defined to be:
$$\delta(V_x,d_i,V_x,d_j) = \frac{|V_x,d_i - V_x,d_j|}{Max_{k\neq i}(V_x,d_k)- Min_{k\neq i}(V_x,d_k)}$$
where $V_x,d_k$ is the value of some metaparameter $V_x$ for dataset $d_k$,
$Max_{k\neq i}(V_x,d_k)$ is the maximum value of $V_x,d_k$ when dataset $i$ is
removed and $Min_{k\neq i}(V_x,d_k)$ is its corresponding minimum. Determining
which dataset has the overall highest uncertainty can be done via the following
procedure. First, sum the relative uncertainties for each dataset and
meta-parameter combination. Then, rank the uncertainty scores of the datasets within
each meta-parameter. After obtaining the uncertainty ranks within each parameter
for each dataset, sum the parameter ranks in order to obtain an overall
uncertainty rank for each dataset. Finally, select the parameter with the
highest rank for inclusion in the metabase. The equation representing the
overall uncertainty score in a specific metaparameter $V_x$ for dataset $d_i$ is
$$\delta(V_x,d_i) = \frac{\sum_{j\neq i} |V_x,d_i - V_x,d_j|}{Max_{k\neq i}(V_x,d_k)- Min_{k\neq i}(V_x,d_k)}$$
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Predicting Relative Performance of Classifiers from Samples}
The third of the meta-learning strategies implemented within this study is one in
which a representative subsection of the metabase is trained with each algorithm
entirely, after which point the rest of the metabase undergoes curve
sampling analysis; the accuracies of the base algorithms are predicted from
run curve similarity rather than directly ran \cite{Leite}.
As with the other two meta learning strategies, the label for new datsets is
then determined via clustering with the datasets contained within the metabase.

\section{Summary of Producible Machines}
The strategies mentioned in the previous section all consume a vector
representation of some dataset, and then make a guess as to what algorithm would best
be able to classify its data. The machines that these strategies can choose from are
the K-means clustering algorithm, a neural network, a naive Bayes classifier, the support
vector machine, and regression; with the results coming from the regression
machine being cast into classificatory bins from the real valued result that it
would produce. An in depth description of each of these different learning
algorithms will comprise the rest of this chapter.

\section{Linear Regression}
Linear regression is one of the most common and oldest machine learning
techniques. It asserts that the response is a linear function
of the inputs \cite{Murphy}. This relation takes the following form:
$$ y(\textbf{x}) = \textbf{w}^T\textbf{x} + \epsilon = \sum_{j=1}^{D}w_jx_j + \epsilon $$
where $w^Tx$ represents the inner or scalar product between the input vector $x$
and the model's weight vector $w^T$, and $\epsilon$ is the residual error
between our linear predictions and the true response.

To fit a linear regression model, the least squares approach is usually used.
Given some  ``overdetermined'' linear system (that is to say a system in which
there are more data points than parameters), one can write an expression for the
sum of squares of the system
$$S(\beta) = (y_1 - \beta x_1)^2 + (y_2 - \beta x_2)^2 + ... (y_n - \beta x_n)^n$$
and then take the partial derivative of this sum of squares deviations with respect
to each of the components of $\beta$, set them to zero, then solve the resulting
equations to directly determine the values of the parameters that
minimize the sum of the squared errors of the system. With linear regression in
two dimensions (one dimension in the Independent variable and one dimension in
the Dependent variable, we see a system with two parameters
$\beta_0 = y intercept$ and $\beta_1 = slope$. If we had, for example, 3 data
points (2,1),(3,7), and (4,5) we would have the equations
$\beta_0 + 2*\beta_1 = 1$, $\beta_0 + 3*\beta_1 = 7$, and
$\beta_0 + 4*\beta_1 = 5$. The sum of squared errors would then be
 $S(\beta_0,\beta_1)= [1 - (\beta_0 + 2*\beta_1)]^2 + [7 - (\beta_0 + 3*\beta_1)]^2 + [5 - (\beta_0 + 4*\beta_1)]^2$
,which we could then differentiate with respect to $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ then
directly solve the resulting set of linear equations directly for the minimum of
the summed squares.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Naive Bayes}
The Naive Bayes classifier algorithm fits a set of data to Bayes' Theorem with a
strong assumption of feature independence. Given a set of discrete-valued
features $x \in {1,...,K}^D$, we can calculate the class conditional density for
each feature, then, with our assumption of independence, generate a guess
at what the class should be for a new input by multiplying the conditional
likelihood values for each of the new inputs features times the prior on the
desired to be known class, that is to say
$p(y|\textbf{x}) \propto p(y) \sum_{j}^{D}p(x_j|y)$.
The calculation of the posterior probability for a new example can be done
manually, or can be derived from distributions that are inferred from the
provided data. Consider, for example, a collection of data listing individuals
that did or did not purchase a house from a real estate agent, where, for some
reason or another, the only data remaining pertaining to these individuals is
what their income level was, what their age was, and how far they have to or
would have had to drive to work from their new home.

Say we get a new datapoint: income: \$25,000, age: 30, distance: 10. In this
case the conditional likelihood of this data given a yes for each of the
individual features is 2/9, 1/9, and 2/9 respectively. The prior on yes is 1/3.
The marginal likelihoods of each the individual features are 2/9, 1/9 and 2/9
respectively. As such, the posteriors for our new datapoint are
$p(y=yes|x)=\frac{(2/9)*(1/9)*(2/9)*(9/27)}{(6/27)*(3/27)*(6/27)} = \frac{0.00182}{0.00548} = 0.33$ and $p(y=no|x)=\frac{(4/18)(2/18)(4/18)(18/27)}{(6/27)(3/27)(6/27)} = \frac{0.0036}{0.00548} = 0.66$.

Note that $0.66 > 0.33$ and as such our classifier would label this datapoint
with a no, this individual is not likely to purchase a house.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Support Vector Machine}
The support vector machine (svm) is a two-group classification algorithm that attempts
to find a hyperplane that separates the inputs within a given input space
with a maximum margin of separation between the hyperplane and the
``support vectors,'' those vectors on either side of the hyperplane
that are closest to it. To arrive at a form of the support vector machine that
can be used to classify new inputs, one first needs a representation of the
potential separating hyperplane $$y_i(\mathbf{w}*\mathbf{x_i} + b) > 1$$ where
$y_i$ is the truth label of given training input $x_i$, $w$ is a vector
normal to our candidate separating hyperplane that represents how much
``weight'' is to be applied to an input, and $b$ is a bias constant representing
the threshold the weight/input product needs to pass before it is considered
classified. The distance of a given hyperplane can be determined by calculating
the difference between these previously mentioned ``support vectors'' in the
direction normal to this hyperplane. This difference can be calculated via the
following equation:
$$(\bold{x_{s+}}-\bold{x_{s-}})\bold{\frac{w}{||w||}}$$ where $\bold{x_{s+}}$
and $\bold{x_{s-}}$ are respectively positive and negative support vectors and
$\bold{\frac{w}{||w||}}$ is the unit vector in the direction normal to the hyper
plane towards the positive examples. The size of the margin is $2/||w||$. As
such, the discovery of a working svm can be accomplished by solving a constrained
optimization problem in which the thing to be minimized is $1/2||w||^2$, subject
to the constraints $y_i(\bold{w}*\bold{x_i} + b) = 1$ for support vectors.
Crafting an expression of this constrained optimization that can be solved by a
computer can be done by taking the Lagrangian:
$$L(\bold{W},\bold{\Lambda}, \bold{Y}) = 1/2||\bold{w}||^2 \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i(\bold{w}*\bold{x_i}+b)-1)$$
then taking care of the fact that the vector $w_o$ that determines the optimal
hyperplane can be written as a linear combination of the training vectors:
$w_{0}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\alpha_{i}^{0}\bold{x_i}$ \cite{Vapnik}. Swapping this
equation into the Lagrangian yields:
$$L = \sum \alpha_{i} - 1/2 \sum_{i}\sum_{j}\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}y_{i}y_{j}(\bold{x_i}\cdot\bold{x_j})$$
at which point one should consult their closest computer so that it can maximize
this expression.

This final form of the Lagrangian reveals the support vector machines most
powerful attribute: the kernel. The optimization of the hyperplane within the
inputs depends only on their dot product of pairs of inputs; they do not appear
anywhere else in the Lagrangian other than the very end and then only so as
pairs of dot products. This fact allows the writing of a decision function on
new inputs: $$f(\bold{u}) = \sum_{i}^{N}\alpha_{i}y_{i}(\bold{x_i}\cdot\bold{u})+b$$
where $\bold{u}$ is a vector whose label we do not know. The support vector
machine can use kernels to map input vectors into
non-linear high-dimensional feature space without actually calculating the
position of the vectors within that feature space \cite{Vapnik}. The kernel
accomplishes this by calculating the distance between (or similarity) of its two
input vectors in this space without reference to their exact position within
this higher space. This then allows the computation of a linear separation
between the points in this higher dimensional space which translates into a
non-linear separation for the vectors in their original lower dimensional space
where a separation might otherwise not have been discoverable.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{K-Means Clustering}
The objective of the k-means algorithm is to partition a dataset into k groups
such that the points within some group are all closest to
the mean of that group than they are to any other group. A clear
informal explanation of the work that the k-means algorithm performs
was given by James MacQueen in 1967: ``...the k-means procedure
consists of simply starting with k groups each of which consists of a
single random point, and thereafter adding each new point to the
group whose mean the new point is nearest. After a point is added to
a group, the mean of that group is adjusted in order to take account
of the new point. Thus at each stage the k-means are, in fact, the
means of the groups they represent'' \cite{MacQueen}. Formally stated,
given an integer $k$ and a set of $n$ data points in
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$ the K-means algorithm seeks to minimize  $\Phi$, the
over all total summed in class distance between each point and its
closest center such that $\mathbb \Phi = \sum_{x \in X} min_{c \in C}{x-c^{2}}$
\cite{Arthur}.

The k-means model is a type of Gaussian mixture model that is trained with a procedure
called expectation maximization. Given a set of distributions with missing data, mixture models tend to have derivatives that are either difficult to define
or are entirely undefinable. On the other hand, the calculation of some ML/MAP (maximum likelihood/maximum a posteriori)
estimates for some set of models can generally be calculated with little
difficulty if every point within the distributions is known (at which point our
learner would obviously have nothing to do) and thus calculus would be entirely
unnecessary ($i.e.$, it would not matter that the derivative cannot be defined).
Expectation maximization uses this fact in order to obtain an estimation of the
ML/MAP indirectly. The algorithm consists of two steps. First, an estimate as
to what the expected value of the hidden data is based off the current guess for the
parameters is made. Then the likelihood function for the parameters is maximized under
the assumption that the data discovered in the previous step is complete, $i.e.$, that there
is no longer any hidden data. These steps are then repeated until some convergence criteria
is met. The k-means is exactly this type of algorithm, but with the covariance matrix
$\Sigma_{k} = \rho^{2}*I_{D}$ and the mixing weights $\Pi_{k} = 1/K$ all being fixed, such
that the only free parameters are the cluster centers $\mu_{k} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$,
and such that the hidden data that is the ground truth label of the data points.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Neural Networks}
A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that mimics
the interconnectivity of animal brains in order to automatically
discover rules to classify given inputs. The neural network is one of the most
flexible learning algorithms within literature, so flexible in fact that it is
capable of approximating any continuous function \cite{Hornik}. As such, its
inclusion within a metalearning system is almost mandatory.  Genrally,
a neural network system works by first being presented with a set of classified or
unclassified inputs. Said system will then attempt to
make a decision on these inputs on which an error value will then be
assigned. The system will then see some kind of correction function
applied to it. This process will continue until the system has
exhausted its supply of training data, at which point it will
hopefully have discovered a strong set of rules for peforming whatever
work it is that it was designed to perform.

The type of neural network that will be used within this thesis is
what is called the feed-forward neural network (multilayer perceptron,
a.k.a. MLP). The feed forward neural network is essentially a series of
logistic regression models stacked on top of each other, with the
final layer being either another logicstic regression or linear
regression model depending on whether or not a classification or
regression problem is being solved \cite{Murphy}. The leftmost
layer of this stack is called the input layer and consists of a set of
neurons ${x_i|x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_m}$ representing the input's
features. Each neuron in the hidden layer transforms the values from
the previous layer via weighted linear summation $w_1X_1 + w_2x_2 +...+w_mx_m$
which is then passed into a non linear-action function $g()$, such as the
logistic function or the hyperbolic tangent function. It is important to note
that $g$ must be non-linear, otherwise the entire model will collapse into a
large linear regression model of the form $y = w^T(Vx)$ \cite{Murphy}.

The multi-layer perceptrons created in this experiment will be trained used in
by an error propagation/training technique called backpropagation.
Backpropagation is a procedure that repeatedly adjusts the weights of the
connections in a neural network so as to minimize a measure of the difference
between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output
vector \cite{Rumelhart}. In order to accomplish this, the algorithm
adjusts the weights of the nerual network by considering the error of
the outputs then minimizes this error via gradient decent with respect
to each of the weights within the network. Specifically, the gradient
vector of the negative log likelihood error on the output neurons is
computed by use of the chain rule of calculus.\cite{Murphy}. Say we
have a one layer neural network in which the hidden layer is described
by $\alpha^{L} = \sigma(w^{L}\alpha^{L-1} + b^{L}) = \sigma(z^{L})$,
where $L$ superscript refers to the hidden layer and $L-1$ refers
to the input layer of the network. The parameters of this network can
be said to be $\Theta = (V,W)$ where $V$ is the weight vector for the input
layer and $W$ is the weight vector for the hidden layer. The error (or
more specifically the costs function) of a such a network is given by:
$$J(\Theta ) = - \sum_n\sum_k(\hat{y}_{nk}(\Theta)-y_{nk})^2$$
in the case of regression, and via cross entropy
$$J(\Theta ) = - \sum_n\sum_ky_{nk}log\hat{y}_{nk}(\Theta)$$
in the case of classification. The gradient of this error $\nabla_{\Theta}J$
is found via the chain rule of calculus:
$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial
w^{L}} = \frac{\partial z^{L}}{\partial
w^{L}}\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial z^{L}}\frac{\partial
  C}{\partial \alpha^{L}}$$
This equation is easiest to understand if read from right to left.
Notice how in each stage the rates being compared are between nearest
elements, first the error to the output that produced it, then the output
to the element to which the non-linearity is applied, then finally the the
non-linerity recieving value to the weight vector. The result of this
calculation easily gives us the direction of the gradient, the negative of
which we will use to modify $w^{L}$ in a direction that will reduce the output
error. Reduction of the error of a multilayer perceptron with more
than one neuron in each layer works mostly the same way. Once again,
the chain rule of calculus is used in order to find the derivative of
the output error with respect to the weights of the connections
between the hidden layer before the output neurons and the output
neurons $\frac{\partial C}{\partial w^{L}_{n-j}}$ where $L$ is the
target neurons layer (the last layer in this case), $n$ is the index of
a neuron within this layer, and $j$ is the index of the neuron in the
previous layer $L-1$ from which neuron $n$ is recieving input (note
that in this case the hyphen does not mean subtract, but rather
indicates that there is a connection between these neurons). For an output
neuron, its error is then given by:
$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial w^{L}_{n-j}} = \frac{\partial z^{L}_{j}}{\partial w^{L}_{n-j}}\frac{\partial \alpha^{L}_{j}}{\partial z^{L}_{j}}\frac{\partial C}{\partial \alpha^{L}_{j}}$$
with the error relative to neurons earlier in the network being calculable by continuing usage of the chain rule.
